# Turtle Race
This game is part of 100 days of python challenge where I've created randomized turtle instances using Turtle Library. 
The user adds input on which turtle they want to be on. 
Once the user chooses the turtle, the race starts, and each turtle will move randomized distance until one of the turtle reaches the goal line.
If the Turtle won is the same color as user has chosen, the user wins.
